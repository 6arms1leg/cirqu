# CirQu - Simple circular queue library

This library employs a simple and tiny

*circular/ring/FIFO/LIFO buffer/queue*

to manage elements in a storage.

## Requirements specification

The following loosely lists requirements, constraints, features and goals.

* Circular/ring/FIFO/LIFO buffering/queueing management of multiple elements
  within a storage in embedded systems for real-time applications
* Element type (and optional type qualifiers) can be chosen at compile time
* Library can be "instantiated" multiple times in one project for different
  element types via C++-like template imitation (facilitates type safety in
  contrast to `void*` usage)
* A new element can be pushed into the queue at its head or tail and the next
  element can be pulled from the tail of the queue
* Each stored element in the queue can be peeked at (i.e. accessed through
  pointer without removal) by its relative index starting from the tail
  position
* Buffer can be queried about its count of available free element slots
* Queue size can be configured at buffer object instantiation by linking
  allocated memory (storage) to it
* Lock-free access possible (with only one producer and consumer if the queue
  never overflows, that is, if `pushHead`/`pushTail` is never issued on a full
  queue
* API (public function) names automatically adjust to element type via
  preprocessor macro to enable the use of multiple queues with different sizes
  within a project without name conflicts

* Library design
* Deployment in embedded systems
* Code implementation in the C programming language ("C99", ISO/IEC 9899:1999)
* Interfaces with the application software through element storage arrays

<!-- Separator -->

* Low impact on technical budgets
    * Low CPU utilization
    * Small memory footprint in ROM (text, data) and RAM (data, heap, stack)
    * Runs (also) well on "small" MCUs (e.g., AVR ATmega328P/Arduino Uno)
* Quality model
    * "Simple" (low complexity of software architecture and detailed design,
      essential features only)
    * Modular
    * Re-usable
    * Portable
    * No unused ("dead") code: optional functionality in seperate translation
      units (so it can be excluded by the linker) or conditionally included via
      preprocessor defines
    * Unit tested with 100 % coverage (LOC executed, branches taken, functions
      called)
    * Defined quality metrics (see table below)
    * MISRA-C:2012 compliant
    * Static code analysis pass
    * No dynamic memory allocation (via `malloc()` or similar)
    * SCM via Git with semantic versioning
* Well documented (from requirements over architecture to detailed design),
  using Doxygen, Markdown, custom diagrams, UML
* Traceability from requirements specification to implementation by
  transitivity

Quality metrics:

| Metric                                       | Target   |
| -------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| No. of parameters/arguments (per func.)      | \<= 6    |
| No. of instructions (per func.)              | \<= 100  |
| No. of nested control structures (per func.) | \<= 5    |
| Cyclomatic complexity number (per func.)     | \<= 10   |
| Comment rate (per file)                      | \>= 20 % |
| Unit test (decision) coverage                | = 100 %  |

## How to deploy

The library can be "instantiated" multiple times in one project for different
element types via C++-like template imitation.
In contrast to the alternative solution of using `void*` element types, this
facilitates type safety.
However, this comes with a slight increase in deployment complexity.

There are two options to deploy this library:

**Option A - Wrapper module with multiple library "instances"**

> The example application uses this option.

With this option, the library is not directly `#include`d and compiled but
instead wrapped in another module, which unites all library "instances" by
configuring and `#include`ing them.
It unconventionally requires to include implementation files in *exactly one
section* of the code as a tradeoff to keep the build process simple.

Below is a header and implementation file of such a wrapper module for an
example with two library "instances" with the suffix IDs `0` and `1`.
Of course, there can be more or less "instances" and the ID names can be
changed as well.

Header file:

```c
#ifndef CIRQUWRAPPER_H
#define CIRQUWRAPPER_H

/* Include CirQu buffer interface (configured with ID 0) */
#define CIRQUID 0
#include "buffer.h"
#undef CIRQUID

/* Include CirQu buffer interface (configured with ID 1) */
#define CIRQUID 1
#include "buffer.h"
#undef CIRQUID

#endif /* CIRQUWRAPPER_H */
```

Implementation file:

```c
/* Include CirQu buffer implementation (configured with ID 0) */
#define CIRQUID 0
#include "buffer.c"
#undef CIRQUID

/* Include CirQu buffer implementation (configured with ID 1) */
#define CIRQUID 1
#include "buffer.c"
#undef CIRQUID
```

*Only* this wrapper module is then compiled and linked and its interface
included, e.g.:

```c
/* Wrapper module with multiple "instances" of CirQu library */
#include "cirquWrapper.h"
```

**Option B - Build library multiple times with different configurations**

> The unit tests use this option (as test coverage can only be measured this
> way).

With this option, the library is directly configured, `#include`d, compiled and
linked multiple times.
It unconventionally requires to wrap each interface inclusion in "external"
include guards (since the interface has none to allow multiple inclusions) and
to configure each interface beforehand.

Below is an example code snipped of such `#include`s for two library
"instances" with the suffix IDs `0` and `1`.
Of course, there can be more or less "instances" and the ID names can be
changed as well.

```c
/* Include CirQu buffer interface (configured with ID 0) */
#ifndef BUFFER_H0
#define BUFFER_H0
#define CIRQUID 0
#include "buffer.h"
#undef CIRQUID
#endif /* BUFFER_H0 */

/* Include CirQu buffer interface (configured with ID 1) */
#ifndef BUFFER_H1
#define BUFFER_H1
#define CIRQUID 1
#include "buffer.h"
#undef CIRQUID
#endif /* BUFFER_H1 */
```

Each library "instance" must then be compiled into a separate object file by
supplying the ID name to the compiler, e.g.:

```sh
$ gcc -DCIRQUID=0 ... -c -I... buffer.c -o buffer0.o
$ gcc -DCIRQUID=1 ... -c -I... buffer.c -o buffer1.o
```

And then all those library "instance" obejct files must be provided to the
linker when linking the application in which this library is used.

**API usage for option A and B**

To use a library "instance"â€™s API (e.g. function calls, variable
declaration/definition), the ID suffix must be appended, e.g. for ID `0`:

```c
stc_bffr_t0 ...;

fn_bffr_ini0(...);
```
